# sudoku
Simple sudoku puzzle game

Written in python, and based on pygame. The "copier.py" file just contains a function to deep copy the array of puzzle values. The "printer.py" file is not used in the main program, but it contains functions that can print out the puzzle in text form. As I was writing the code, I started with just a text version until I could get the math to work out, and then worried about the visual elements later.
